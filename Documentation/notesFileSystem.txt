A root filesystem must contain everything needed to support a full Linux system. To be able to do this, the disk must include the minimum requirements for a Linux system:

    The basic file system structure,

    Minimum set of directories: /dev, /proc, /bin, /etc, /lib, /usr, /tmp,

    Basic set of utilities: sh, ls, cp, mv, etc.,

    Minimum set of config files: rc, inittab, fstab, etc.,

    Devices: /dev/hd*, /dev/tty*, /dev/fd0, etc.,

    Runtime library to provide basic functions used by utilities.
